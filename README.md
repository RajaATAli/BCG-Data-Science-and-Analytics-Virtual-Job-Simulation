### Task 1: Business Understanding and Hypothesis Framing

**Objective:** Formulate a data-driven approach to test the hypothesis that `customer churn` in PowerCo's SME segment is driven by price sensitivity, outlining necessary data, ideal data framework, potential exploratory analyses, and suitable predictive models

*Hypothesis:* "SME customers are churning due to price sensitivity, and offering a 20% discount could reduce this churn.‚Äù

**What I learned in this task:**
- Gained insights into the real-world implications of customer churn in the energy sector.
- Learned how to translate business problems into testable data science hypotheses.
- Gained knowledge about the end-to-end process of predictive modeling.
- Produced a deliverable in the form of a professional email outlining the approach to the hypothesis testing.
