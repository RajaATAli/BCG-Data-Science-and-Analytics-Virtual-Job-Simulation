## Program Duration and Role

## Tasks Overview

### Task 1: Business Understanding and Hypothesis Framing

#### Objective
Formulate a data-driven approach to test the hypothesis that `customer churn` in PowerCo's SME segment is driven by price sensitivity. Outline the necessary data, ideal data framework, potential exploratory analyses, and suitable predictive models.

#### Hypothesis
"SME customers are churning due to price sensitivity, and offering a 20% discount could reduce this churn.‚Äù

#### What I learned in this task:
- Gained insights into the real-world implications of customer churn in the energy sector.
- Learned how to translate business problems into testable data science hypotheses.
- Gained knowledge about the end-to-end process of predictive modeling.
- Produced a deliverable in the form of a professional email outlining the approach to the hypothesis testing.

### Task 2: Exploratory Data Analysis

### Task 3: Feature Engineering and Modeling

### Task 4: Findings and Recommendations

#### Objective
Create a clear, concise, and persuasive executive summary slide that synthesizes key findings from the project for a non-technical audience, articulates their impact on the client's bottom line, and suggests potential courses of action. Prepare it for presentation in a stakeholders' meeting.

#### What I learned in this task:
- How to distill complex project findings into a concise and business-focused executive summary. This includes understanding the key insights derived from the project, their impact on the client's bottom line, and potential courses of action.
- The significance of understanding your audience when communicating technical findings. The executive summary should be tailored in a way that it is accessible and meaningful to non-technical stakeholders, emphasizing strategic implications over raw data or technical details.
